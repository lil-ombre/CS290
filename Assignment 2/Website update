Redesign:
  I want my website to keep the same structure as illistruted in my design photos for assignment one but with more design.
  I know I want add color and keep the website red, black, and white to resemble the colorway of the original Air Jordan.
  Im going to add square borders to my images and videos. Im also going to add new fonts to make the website look more professional and make 
  the font size for my title a lot bigger. Im going to center everything like in my original design(also including the fun facts) and space out 
  the Extras section so everything isnt so crowded and im going to to completely redesign my table to make it more colorful and make it larger in size.
  I will leave pics of my orignal design down below.
