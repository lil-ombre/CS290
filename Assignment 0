1.https://www.youtube.com/. Youtube is a really great website that is built to be easy to use. Its not too flashy because all the attention goes to the videos and
they are layed out in organized "genres". The website constantly updates and recommends new videos you may like. For the user, youtube is very easy to use
but for creators, the monitering of videos and the content they contain can cause problems for the creators since bots are used to view the huge amount of content 
uplaoded everyday. The website could be improved by fixing the comments system and having better live streams.

2.https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwii2oiY64PuAhWMvp4KHTwtCEUQPAgI. Google is another really helpful and useful website. The search engine makes 
makes looking for whatever you need really easy. The suggestions that come up when you type saves you some time and the design is very simple but iconic. I 
havnt used all the apps in google but things like google drive, docs, slides etc. are really great and very simple to use and they do so much and very useful. 
The only thing i dont like using is gmail, I hate checking my email through the google website, its very cluttered and not polished and quick and easy to use like 
the other apps. I would recommend updating gmail, i usually check it through my Iphone.

3.https://www.apple.com/?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_487973241832_pgrid_13945964887_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-. The
Apple website is all about style. It is a really pretty website with high quality images and you can tell a lot of thought was put into the layout of the website.
Everything you're looking for is easy to find and the website makes it feel like a journey with each product being advertised as the best thing humans have ever
made. The only thing I would nitpick is that loading a new page takes a second since the website is so fancy.

4.https://www.nike.com. Nike's website is very useful and quick when it comes to looking for what you need. The website helps you browse the huge cataloge with
suggestions that come up when you type and the many filters you can add to your search. For such a famous company, The website doesnt feel like it conveys Nike's
status. It could use more personality with a theme of colors and a more interesting home page with a better layout.

5.https://www.adidas.com/. The Adidas website is a huge step up frome the nike website. The homepage looks like the layout was well thought out and has important
categories that make shopping easy to use and the website lets you know whats popular/trending and shows new products and best sellers. It does a well job of 
organizing the huge cataloge of clothing and has multiple images for each item that you can look at by hovering the mouse over the image. The website runs pretty
well but can be weird to use if you're not going slow because the images keep flashing as youre mouse moves past them.
